## What does it do?
- Informs the user that it's necessary to determine who rolls first
- Informs the user that the prog has chosen a number which is either 0 or 1
- Prompts the user to guess which one it is
- Accepts the value of 0 or 1
- Alternatively exits the prog or shows help
,
## How is it used?
- **Where?** Section 1
- **Returns?** A number: either 0 or 1. It's then compared to the one generated by the prog. If the numbers are equal, the player rolls first. If not, it's the opposite.
